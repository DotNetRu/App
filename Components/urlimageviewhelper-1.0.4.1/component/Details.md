UrlImageViewHelper is an Android library developed by [Koushik Dutta](https://github.com/koush) that sets an ImageView's contents from a url.  It manages image downloading, caching, and makes your coffee too.  UrlImageViewHelper will fill an ImageView with an image that is found at a URL.

## Features
 
 - **Asynchronous** - Fetches images from a URL asynchronously
 - **Optional Placeholder** - Specify a placeholder image to display while the image is loading
 - **Pre-load Images** - You can load an image before needing it so it's ready and available in the cache.
 - **Reusable View (ConvertView) compatible** - Can be used in List Adapters where convertView is used to increase performance.
