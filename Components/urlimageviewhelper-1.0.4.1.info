{"Name":"UrlImageViewHelper Android","Id":2134,"Alias":"urlimageviewhelper","Description":"UrlImageViewHelper is an Android library developed by [Koushik Dutta](https://github.com/koush) that sets an ImageView\u0027s contents from a url.  It manages image downloading, caching, and makes your coffee too.  UrlImageViewHelper will fill an ImageView with an image that is found at a URL.\n\n## Features\n \n - **Asynchronous** - Fetches images from a URL asynchronously\n - **Optional Placeholder** - Specify a placeholder image to display while the image is loading\n - **Pre-load Images** - You can load an image before needing it so it\u0027s ready and available in the cache.\n - **Reusable View (ConvertView) compatible** - Can be used in List Adapters where convertView is used to increase performance.\n\n## Learn More\nLearn more about [UrlImageViewHelper](https://github.com/koush/UrlImageViewHelper).","Version":"1.0.4.1","Summary":"Async Image Lazy Loading and Caching for Android","QuickStart":"UrlImageViewHelper will automatically download and manage all the web images and ImageViews. Duplicate urls will not be loaded into memory twice. Bitmap memory is managed by using a weak reference hash table, so as soon as the image is no longer used by you, it will be garbage collected automatically.\n\n**Usage is simple:**\n\n```csharp\nKoush.UrlImageViewHelper.SetUrlDrawable (imageView, \"http://example.com/image.png\");\n```\n\nWant a placeholder image while it is being downloaded?\n\n```csharp\nKoush.UrlImageViewHelper.SetUrlDrawable (imageView, \"http://example.com/image.png\", Resource.Drawable.placeholder);\n```\n\nDon\u0027t want to use a placeholder resource, but a drawable instead?\n\n```csharp\nKoush.UrlImageViewHelper.SetUrlDrawable (imageView, \"http://example.com/image.png\", drawable);\n```\n\nWhat if you want to preload images for snazzy fast loading?\n\n```csharp\nKoush.UrlImageViewHelper.LoadUrlDrawable (context, \"http://example.com/image.png\");\n```\n\nWhat if you only want to cache the images for a minute?\n\n```csharp\n// Note that the 3rd argument \"null\" is an optional interstitial placeholder image.\nKoush.UrlImageViewHelper.SetUrlDrawable (imageView, \"http://example.com/image.png\", null, 60000);\n```\n\n## Learn More\nLearn more about [UrlImageViewHelper](https://github.com/koush/UrlImageViewHelper).\n\n","Hash":"6f5ea914dd54fb6f2c6c59144b144d25","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
